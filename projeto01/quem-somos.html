			<p>One morning, my mother woke me up and told me that my Aunt Zeny and her children were downstairs. They came to invite us for a swim at the beach. The beach is just an hour away from our place, so my mom decided to go with them. My mom helped me prepare my bag. We did not cook any food since we would buy snacks on the way. I could see my cousins’ excitement as we headed towards the beach. I was excited, too. However, I am afraid of the water and can’t swim. All of my cousins hurriedly went to the shore as we arrived. I panicked a little, but I saw my mother staring at me. She was smiling at me. It was like she was telling me to, “Go ahead son, and learn to swim.”</p>

			<p>Sara lived in a small town away from the City. There’s only one grocery store in their town because only a few people lived there. One day, Sara and her husband’s car broke down. Her husband couldn’t go to work, and she couldn’t go to the grocery store. They walked to ask help from neighbors. There were a few houses at a distance, but they found out that the houses have been abandoned. They didn’t have neighbors! They were already out of food that day. So, they waited for vehicles to pass by so they could ask for a ride. A truck passed by and they were able to get to the grocery store. When they got to the grocery store, they saw a sign at the door saying “store closed due to bankruptcy.”</p>
